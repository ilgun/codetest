Scheduling algorithm behaves as a normal elevator in our lives.

 given(elevator) is on 1st floor.
 when(elevator) receives order for pickup request on 4rd floor for going up.
 when(elevator) receives order for pickup request on 3rd floor for going down.
 then(elevator) goes to 4rd floor for picking up because it check if elevator is already in going up direction.
 then(elevator) goes to 3rd floor for picking up the last order.

 There are some test examples which should explain the possible situations of the algorithm.
 Basically elevator decides which floor to go first according to the current direction however, if the is no other in current direction then,
 elevator will pick the first one for going down.
 These orders are in a sorted manner thus, elevator shouldn't have problems such as going to 3rd floor first and then 5rd floor and after 4rd floor. (given the pickup directions are same)
